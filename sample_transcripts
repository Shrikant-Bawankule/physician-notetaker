Physician: Good morning, Ms. Jones. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I’m doing better, but I still have some pain in my neck and back sometimes.
Physician: I understand you had a car accident in September. Can you describe what happened?
Patient: Yes, it was on September 1st, around noon. I was rear-ended and hit my head on the steering wheel. I went to the hospital and they said it was a whiplash injury.
Physician: Did you receive any treatment?
Patient: Yes, I took painkillers and had ten physiotherapy sessions. The first few weeks were difficult, but I feel much better now.
Physician: Are you still in pain?
Patient: Only occasionally. I can sleep better now and drive without discomfort.
Physician: That’s good to hear. I believe you’re on track for a full recovery within six months.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it.
